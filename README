Server-Client Concurrency

This is a multi-threaded server designed to handle multiple client connections and simultaneously fulfill multiple client requests.

The Client GUI is designed to remain active while jobs are performing using Threads and Runnable Classes.


The Client side program is designed using three classes:
 
	1. ControlPanel - Handles any controls necessary
	
	2. ClientGUI    - Generates what the user sees
	
	3. Client       - Combines both classes ControlPanel and ClientGUI and creates the JFrame



To use:
	

1.) Run the server
	
2.) Run the client

	3.) Find out the server's IP by running ifconfig in the Linux terminal on the computer that the server is running on.
    
		Note: use the inet address.
	
4.) Input the IP into the IP-Address box, set a bit-length for an integer and press GenPrime.
    
		Note: Integers with bit-length greater than 5000 take some time to generate.
